# IMPORTANT INFORMATION

Tom, I came across this open repo while scrolling through GitHub, and it does look like your Microsoft Hackathon repo is currently open to the world...

### **SET YOUR REPO TO PRIVATE and ENABLE SSH** 
- You can test your ssh key connection locally through:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

Thanks
